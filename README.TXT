VDLGBX offers you the creating and using of arbitrary composed
dialog-boxes when running gvim in a WIN-Environment.
By the side it has some HTML-authoring features.

*Password-Field
*Checkboxes (switches)
*Listbox
*Combobox

Installing:
Copy VDLGBX.DLL into your VIM-folder (eg. vim62)

Read and execute the VDLGBX.VIM - I think it's all explained there.
